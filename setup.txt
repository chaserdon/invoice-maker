Invoice Maker v1.0
------------------

This program allows a Yahoo Store owner to create a invoice/packing slip that includes a company logo, message for the customer and will display a detailed price breakdown of each order.  It does require some computer knowledge such as how to transfer files between computer systems. 


INTALLING:
1. Upload INDEX.HTML and INVOICE.PHP to your web server.  You can rename INDEX.HTML to INVOICE.HTML or some other file name if this file already exist on your server.


RUNNING:
This program needs ITEMS.CSV, PRODUCTS.CSV and ORDERS.CSV to work.  

1.  Go into your Yahoo Store Manager.
2.  Click the Orders link under Process category.
3.  Next to the export button select a range of orders that you want to use.
4.  You will be presented with a list of CSV files.  Please download the ITEMS.CSV, PRODUCTS.CSV and ORDERS.CSV.  
(These files will have different name, but don't worry about that the program knowns how to name them.)
5.  Once you have those files saved in a known location on your computer, you will then run INDEX.HTML on your web server.  
6.  From here you can upload the three CSV files along with an image logo and a message for your customer.
7.  Click the Submit Button and your invoice will be displayed.
8.  To print click the Make Ready Print button and use the print function from within your browser.
